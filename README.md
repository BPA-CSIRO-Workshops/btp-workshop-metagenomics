This repository provides a minimalistic base template for creating a hands-on workshop
following the framework set out in the Bioinformatics Training Platform (BTP). Below we have
provided various entry-points, by way of workflows, to demonstrate the various ways in which you
can utilise existing workshops and workshop modules. We also provide information on how to go about
developing your own modules and workshops.

General Workflows
=================



Resuing an Existing BTP Workshop
--------------------------------
The easiest way to get started is to use an existing Bioinformatics Training Platform (BTP)
workshop. To see a list of current BTP workshops head over to:
https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops?query=btp-workshop-

For the purpose of this example workflow we are going to use the [btp-workshop-ngs]
(https://github.com/BPA-CSIRO-Workshops/btp-workshop-ngs) repository.
